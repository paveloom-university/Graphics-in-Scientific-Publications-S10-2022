% Abstract of the paper
\begin{abstract}
In orbital mechanics, the eccentric anomaly is an angular
parameter that defines the position of a body that is moving
along an elliptic Kepler orbit. The eccentric anomaly is one
of three angular parameters ("anomalies") that define a position
along an orbit, the other two being the true anomaly and the mean
anomaly.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% BODY OF PAPER %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Introduction}

This is a copy-paste of the Wikipedia article of the same name, which
is based on \citet{Murray1999, Plummer1960}. The point of this exercise
is to get familiarized with the style conventions of scientific journals
(here, MNRAS).

\section{Graphical representation}

Consider the ellipse with equation given by:

\begin{equation}
  x=\frac{x^2}{a^2} + \frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1.
  \label{eq:ellipse}
\end{equation}

where $a$ is the semi-major axis and $b$ is the semi-minor axis.

For a point on the ellipse, $ P = P(x, y) $, representing the position
of an orbiting body in an elliptical orbit, the eccentric anomaly is
the angle $E$ in the figure. The eccentric anomaly $E$ is one of the
angles of a right triangle with one vertex at the center of the ellipse,
its adjacent side lying on the major axis, having hypotenuse a (equal
to the semi-major axis of the ellipse), and opposite side (perpendicular
to the major axis and touching the point $P'$ on the auxiliary circle of
radius a) that passes through the point $P$. The eccentric anomaly is
measured in the same direction as the true anomaly, shown in the
Fig.~\ref{fig:eccentric_anomaly} as $f$. The eccentric anomaly $E$ in
terms of these coordinates is given by:

\begin{equation}
  \cos{E} = \frac{x}{a},
\end{equation}

and

\begin{equation}
  \sin{E} = \frac{y}{b}.
\end{equation}

The second equation is established using the relationship

\begin{equation}
  \left( \frac{y}{b} \right)^2 = 1 - \cos^2{E} = \sin^2{E},
\end{equation}

which implies that $ \sin{E} = \pm \frac{y}{b} $. The equation
$ \sin{E} = \frac{-y}{b} $ is immediately able to be ruled out since it
traverses the ellipse in the wrong direction. It can also be noted that
the second equation can be viewed as coming from a similar triangle with
its opposite side having the same length $y$ as the distance from $P$ to the
major axis, and its hypotenuse $b$ equal to the semi-minor axis of the ellipse.

\section{Conclusions}

Hence, the eccentric anomaly is one of the parameters that determines the
position of a body on an elliptic Kepler orbit.
